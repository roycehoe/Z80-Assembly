# Introduction

A project to learn assembly by creating my own pokemon save file

# Getting started

[There is no getting started]

# Non-project accomplishments

- Disassemble a pokemon game and save file by monitoring how bytes change between different states, and generally messing around
- Use a GUI debugger to watch changes in memory (All debuggers I used previously were CLI debuggers. Go figure)
